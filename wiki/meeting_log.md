Summary: This meeting allowed us to expand on the idea we generated in the brainstorming session and identify the core features

We focused on identifying the core features of our application and the core problems we are trying to solve.

Serves is meant to improve the accessibility of booking and viewing local service providers.

We identified 4 main features of our app to be:

-   being able to book services (have a calendar and availability embedded)
-   being able to provide services
-   being able to view local services (map)
-   being able to advertise your services (post on an image board, link to social media, etc.)

We also spent time finding the most important part of the project... the colour pallete

**Intro Meeting**

> Jan 20th 12:30-2pm
> _Attending Members: Caden, Arvind, Andy, Risto_

Summary: This meeting allowed us to begin the discussion about project ideas and a tech stack.

**Details:**
We discussed what kind of software we want to create and the tech stack we would like to work with. After some conversation we agreed on creating a full stack application accessible through web and mobile built using React Native. We talking about some hosting and backend possibilities but agreed the conversation could be delayed for the future.

We also discussed ideas and what our app could be about. We had several ideas but eventually settled on creating an application that improves finding and booking local services. Some of the scrapped ideas involved a social media recipe sharing platform, a hub of food delivery services that showed all restaurants available to you locally by getting an aggregate of the delivery services, a trading application and more!
